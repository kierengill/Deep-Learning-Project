__Project Description:__

Problem Statement: The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting breast cancer in mammograms, enabling earlier detection and improved patient outcomes.

Solution Approach: Our approach combines transfer learning, region of interest (ROI) cropping, and a hybrid model of object detection and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve accurate breast cancer detection. We used CAM-Grad to help with the interpretability of the model. 

Value/Benefit: The developed model has the potential to significantly enhance breast cancer detection, reducing false negatives, and ultimately leading to more effective treatment and higher survival rates.
